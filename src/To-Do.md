- [x] Error handling
- [x] Ensure the encryption and decryption functions are air-tight
- [x] Add a secure-erase function for the input/source file
- [x] Run some more tests, specifically on large files
- [x] Test keyfile functionality
- [x] Don't show stdin text when entering password inside of the terminal
- [x] Add checks for output files so we don't overwrite any by mistake
- [x] Hash the file before encryption and after decryption, so the user can confirm the data is *exactly* the same
- [x] Use clap subcommands instead of arguments to make it easier to use
- [x] Optimise reading the input/output files, so less disk usage
  - [x] Find a way to encrypt **large** files (larger than the system's memory)
  - [x] Optimise memory usage in general too
- [x] Further optimise the reading and handling of the data, especially in memory.
  - [x] Larger files in `hashing` mode will cause `dexios` to force quit, due to absurdly high memory usage. This is because the data is being copied in memory multiple times, instead of re-using the same buffer. I believe this needs a `Cursor` to resolve, and a patch will be released once I have found the best solution.
- [x] Refactor/split everything into semi-specialised files, to make the codebase more maintainable
- [x] Add benchmarking switch that doesn't write to the disk
- [x] Manually `zeroize` sensitive data in RAM
- [x] Add nice error handling for AES-GCM functions
- [x] AES-GCM stream with [StreamLE31](https://docs.rs/aead/latest/aead/stream/struct.StreamLE31.html)
- [x] Unify rng (maybe OsRng?)
- [x] Add a check for when the keyfile exists, but it has no data
- [ ] Prevent the output file from even being created in bench+stream mode
- [x] Add print for "encrypting in normal mode"
- [x] Move this huge README to a Github Wiki
- [x] Test blake3's multithreading to see performance benefits
  - [x] It was slower so it will not be implemented
- [x] Panic error handling (especially on encrypt/decrypt)
- [ ] Support for steganography
- [ ] Colored output
  - [ ] Maybe for errors too - `color_eyre`
- [ ] Test more OSes
- [ ] Look into alternatives for `rpassword` that don't involve serde
- [ ] Github Actions for cargo publish + uploading a release of Dexios
  - [ ] sha256sum the file within the action, so users can compare the hashes
- [ ] Cross-platform building with GA (freebsd especially)
- [x] Add an option for --erase x to set the amount of passes
  - [x] Default value = 16
- [x] Possibly protect memory-mode raw data with Secret<>
- [x] Make get_file_bytes return a `Secret<Vec<u8>>`, to protect all read data
- [x] Make get_password_with_validation return a `Secret<Vec<u8>>`
  - [x] Make all sensitive data returned directly as a `Secret`, so we don't have to rely on the calling function doing so
- [ ] Overhaul keyfile handling (stop relying on an empty string in key.rs)
- [x] Add a mode for forcing password-entry via the terminal (e.g. --pass)
- [ ] Implement an option for XChaCha20-Poly1305
  - [ ] In both stream and memory mode
  - [ ] Look at making it the default (with a -g switch for GCM)
