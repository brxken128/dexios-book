## Secret Wrapper

We have implemented our own `Secret<>` wrapper/type, that implements zeroize-on-drop. This ensures all sensitive information is securely zeroed-out once it is no longer required, and that the sensitive informatiton is only accessed when explicit calls are made. Our implementation was inspired by the `secrecy` crate's functionality, so I'd like to provide a huge thanks to the original creators.
