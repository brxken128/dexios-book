## Performance Notes

Please note that performance is heavily dependent on your hardware - mostly disk speed. Dexios has had a *lot* of performance optimisations applied throughout the versions, but we're getting to the point where the main factor is disk speed.

To see this for yourself, run one command without the `-b` switch, and the very same command with the `-b` switch.

Using `Deoxys-II-256` will result in degraded performance, please view the [Security Notices](../Introduction.md#security-notices) for relevant information.

We will continue to optimise Dexios where possible.
