## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report any vulnerabilities as a Github issue - we believe all issues should be known, and they are likely to get resolved very quickly this way. Thank you.

As an alternative, you may contact `brxken128@tutanota.com`

If you find any vulnerabilities within Dexios, and can provide steps/pointers to reproduce, please report them. You may do this anonymously via the email above. I'm afraid I cannot offer any money in return, but I can add you to the list of contributors (at your request).
